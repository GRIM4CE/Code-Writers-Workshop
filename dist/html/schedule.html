          <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
            <p>Writing well-crafted, robust code isn't just about producing code that runs and does what it was intended to do. It also includes all of the critical, unsexy things (CUTs) that make well-crafted code extensible, iterable, shareable, understandable, and, well... pleasant to work with. Nick Peddy, CTO for Capital One Investing, will discuss the critical concepts of code craftsmanship that apply across all development environments and the ever-changing technology landscape. Regardless of whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out in your career, attention to code craftmanship will help set you apart from the crowd and build your reputation as an outstanding contributor.</p>

              <p>Technology is exploding, and we are scrambling just to keep pace.

              <p>Have you ever worked so hard to get the skills you need, only to find that you can't get a job?

With my workshop, 'Relationship Action Plan, Yes, it is about who you know," You will learn how to build your goals in a way that aligns you with a network that supports you.

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>I know it's heretical, but there's more to life than writing code! You live, breath, and think code, so how do you go about applying your propeller brain to the rest of life? Let's take some time to talk about the relationships, babies, hobbies, vacations, faith, and finances, and how these aspects of life might be unique or different for software developer types. It's tempting to call such topics an aside, but as a matter of fact, it's pretty much central. Try as you may, you will not be successful at neglecting the rest of life no matter how much you love typing semicolons. What is it that makes developers different? What life hacks can you apply to improve efficiency in the build process and continuous delivery of life itself?</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>We all want to work in a team that feels dependable and encouraging, but so often that goes by the wayside when things get busy. How can you build a strong culture that respects team members with different strengths? How do you build trust that weathers bumps in the road? Is it possible to change the culture when you're not a manager? In this talk, we'll review some strategies for building great respect, transparency and support whether you're a team member or a leader.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>Interpersonal relationships are hard. And better yet, they're unavoidable. The Non-Violent Communication (or NVC) methodology can be used to establish a workplace environment of mutual respect through empathy, and honest communication. At first glance, it may seem that 'non-violent' is a superfluous adjective to put before the word 'communication'. In reality, it is the most effective way to empower everyone in an organization to be heard, and to have a voice. This workshop will take a deep dive into a concrete problem you are experiencing at work, and will give you a tool to approach workplace conflict in a constructive manner. (Bonus: NVC can also be applied to relationships outside of the workplace).</p>

            <h4 class="talk-speaker">with Rebekah Bastian of Zillow</h4>
            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>While early roles in a technology career may be as clear as applying for a job that fits your background and taking on assigned work, the path to leadership is often not as well defined. The biggest step functions in my career – from entry-level program manager to technology executive – have come from finding opportunities and filling needs that were not yet discovered. Examples of this include creating the initial Zillow mobile apps when the iPhone was first released, and building out Zillow’s first social impact product, Community Pillar, through a series of Hack Weeks. Creating opportunities that leverage my passions and interests has been a great way of growing in my career, and having a lot of fun along the way.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>What do you want to be known for? Success and self-fulfillment come from so much more than writing great code and keeping up with technology. Many things form who you are as a leader: how you contribute to team culture and foster inclusion, mentorship, sponsorship, ally skills, and yes - even activism. Being the kind of leader people follow takes planning, practice, self-awareness, and the help of community - just like learning how to write great code. Let's talk about how you can take action towards discovering your own authenticity and leadership style as you grow your career.</p>
