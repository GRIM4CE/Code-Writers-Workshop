            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>Software developers who want to take a path toward management don't often get much guidance. Even developers acting as tech leads don't always get the authority or blessing from management they would like, in order to build a higher-functioning team, or execute a cultural or technical turnaround. In this talk, you'll learn tried and true strategies for building trust, getting technical buy-in, mentoring developers, and achieve leadership success when you're just a normal developer without a fancypants title.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>Tech companies known for having strong culture are often some of the most sought after places to work. Hiring for an aligned set of values, not a shared culture, will create a shared sense of purpose and guarantee the long-term success of your team. I'll cover my first-hand experience shifting our engineering team to a values-first approach, and the incredible results that followed.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>One of the notional ideas about software engineering is that the only thing that matters is how good the engineering is. But software isn't created in a vacuum: this talk examines why some of the most important work we need to do to build successful software and have impact as an engineer is in fact anthropology. We will discuss some useful ways to look at the roles, structures, and patterns within teams and organizations that can lead to useful insights on how to be more impactful as a software engineer.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>Leading without buy-in from your team is difficult; leading without buy-in from yourself is impossible. Yet, many engineering leaders still try to do just that, leading others while doubting their own qualifications and abilities at every turn. In this talk, I'll discuss some of the most important leadership characteristics to cultivate—not only in others, but in ourselves as well. I'll draw on my experience as a developer who went from a boot-camp graduate to a team lead in just over a year, expanding from 3 developers to 12 with over 60% women and minorities.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>Ever since the time of the dinosaurs, it has been shown that life can be a constant battle between those who are at the top of the food chain, and those at the bottom. Today, things are no different in the work place. Those who are loud and pushy get their ideas heard while those who are quiet and reserved can go unnoticed. What about those who fall in between? Where do they fit in? This talk strives to bring strategies to break down those barriers and create a more cohesive work culture instead of a food chain.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>While writing front-end code in an agile team with all engineers and no dedicated UX person, it falls into the shoulder of the engineers to follow through the UI/UX Nirvana. How do we make sure the team is developing features and products that satisfy the user needs? How do we involve the quality engineers to assure that the user interface is up to the mark? I will describe my team's experience and process to ensure this and suggest what works and what does not.</p>

<p>In this exercise, we would discuss who to come up with a standard for building and maintaining a UI widget library to maintain unification across the product.<p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>When you are developing a new product, time is of the essence. You want to pull in the best developers, start brainstorming and surveying strangers at a coffee shop, and then deliver the best experience. But getting the best developers is hard. You don’t want to be limited to developers who only know a single stack and you don’t want to get bogged down in fights over technologies. So what do choose to compromise: productivity, performance, time to market, or talent? What if you didn’t have to compromise? This talk will go over what speed means to you and why microservices will keep you ahead of competitors.</p>

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>Agile organizations often talk about the need to test hypotheses when developing products. A minimal viable product (MVP) is supposed to be smallest unit you can ship that will test that hypothesis. At edX, we've taken that philosophy and applied it to our internal processes and culture, fostering a culture where every employee is empowered to run experiments to try to improve how we do things day to day. We can approach cultural improvements like we do product improvements: we can find ways to measure them, we can learn from our mistakes, and we can lead with testable hypotheses. In this talk, I'm going to touch upon how we started to build a culture of experimentation, from how we came up with the idea of one to how we cultivated one. Along the way, we'll look at some specific experiments we tried out and what we learned from them. Finally, I'll give some advice on trying out this approach, addressing things that worked for us and challenges we faced.</p>

              <p>One of the great things about working in software engineering is all the new technology that pops up every day.

            <div class="read-more-text" data-state="closed">
              <p>In the agile software development world, "scope creep" is something development teams are taught to avoid at all costs. It's a frequent source of friction between technical teams and their stakeholders, and it can lead to a toxic environment when the balance swings too wildly in one direction or another.</p>
              <p>But what if I told you that there's actually no such thing as scope creep? What if I told you that what we know as "scope creep" is actually the main reason agile software development came into existence in the first place - so that teams could adequately deal with the kind of rapidly changing environments, opinions, and learnings that are vital to build successful software products in this day and age.</p>
